This project contains shared validations for EfModels,ViewModel and API models
The purpose is to share the same validator across EfModels,ViewModel and API models. Each model implements an interface and the validator is applied on the interface
The validation is based on the fluent validation of Jeremy Skinner on https://github.com/JeremySkinner/FluentValidation
